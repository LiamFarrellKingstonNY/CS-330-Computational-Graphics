# CS 330 – Computational Graphics and Visualization

## Final Project: 3D Still-Life Scene

This project demonstrates:
- 3D object construction using primitive meshes
- Texture mapping
- Phong lighting (ambient, diffuse, specular)
- Interactive camera controls (WASD, QE, mouse look, scroll speed)
- Perspective and orthographic projection toggle

Built using C++ and OpenGL framework provided by SNHU.
